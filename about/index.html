	<p>Born Irish.  Naturalized Australian.  Resident American.  Home is where
	my heart is.<br>
	Having graduated B.E. in 2003 from University College Dublin I spent a couple
	of years in the pharmaceutical industry working on installing instrumentation
	and digital automation plant before accidentally emigrating to Australia in
	2005.  The 'lucky country' lived up to its name and a year-long working
	holiday turned into a career in energy and telecommunications design, engineering
	and deployment.  For over 9 years I worked across the nation-continent on wireless,
	fiber-optic and emergency service radio networks for <a href="telstra.com.au">
		Telstra</a>, <a href="optus.com.au">SingTel Optus</a>, <a href="nbnco.com.au">
			NBNCo</a> and <a href="motorolasolutions.com">Motorola</a> before once again
	crossing seas to California.</p>

	<p>These days I'm a technical Program Manager at <a href="fiber.google.com">Google Fiber</a>
	(get ready, <a href="twitter.com/#fiberiscoming">#fiberiscoming</a>) managing
	an awesome team of PgMs and engineers working on deploying new things in new
	ways.  It's a pretty sweet deal :)</p>

    oncoming civilization, themselves vanish before the civilization for
    which they have prepared the way.</em></p>

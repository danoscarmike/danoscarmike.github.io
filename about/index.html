      <p>The pioneer days pass; the stump-dotted clearings expand into vast
        stretches of fertile farm land; the stockaded clusters of log cabins
        change into towns; the hunters of game, the fellers of trees, the rude
        frontier traders and tillers of the soil, the men who wander all their
        lives long through the wilderness as the heralds and harbingers of an
        oncoming civilization, themselves vanish before the civilization for
        which they have prepared the way.</p>

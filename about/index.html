	<p>Born Irish.  Naturalized Australian.  Resident American.  Home is where
	my heart is.<br>
	Having graduated B.E. in 2003 from University College Dublin I spent a couple
	of years in the pharmaceutical industry working on installing instrumentation
	and digital automation plant before accidentally emigrating to Australia in
	2005.  The 'lucky country' lived up to its name and a year-long working
	holiday turned into a career in energy and telecommunications design, engineering
	and deployment.  For over 9 years I worked across the nation-continent delivering wireless,
	fiber-optic and emergency service radio network programs for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstra">
		Telstra</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optus">SingTel Optus</a>,
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nbn_(telecommunications_company)">
			NBN</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Solutions">Motorola</a>;
			before once again crossing seas to California.</p>

	<p>These days I'm a Program Manager at <a href="fiber.google.com">Google Fiber</a>
	(get ready, <a href="twitter.com/#fiberiscoming">#fiberiscoming</a>) managing
	an awesome team of PgMs and engineers working on deploying new things in new
	ways - willfully attempting to make ourselves redundant.  It's a pretty sweet deal :)</p>

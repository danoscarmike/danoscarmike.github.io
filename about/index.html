			<p>Having graduated B.E. (Electronic) in 2003 from University College Dublin I spent 2
			years working on instrumentation and digital automation before accidentally emigrating to Australia in
			2005.  A year-long working holiday turned into 9 years in telecommunications design, engineering
			and deployment.  In that time I delivered wireless, fiber-optic and emergency service radio network programs
			for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstra">Telstra</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optus">SingTel Optus</a>,
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nbn_(telecommunications_company)">NBN</a> and
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Solutions">Motorola</a>.  In 2014 I once again crossed seas, to California, and to Google.
				I've worked in network engineering and deployment at <a href="https://fiber.google.com">Google Fiber</a>, and API design governance and SDK development 
				at <a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google Cloud</a>. All while
				completing a <a href="https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/">Masters in Computer and Information Technology</a> from the University of Pennsylvania.

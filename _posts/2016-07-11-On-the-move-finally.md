I have been day-dreaming, whispering and sometimes talking about doing this for a long long time.  Well I finally have.  Thanks to the awesome guide put together by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and the magical power of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) I bring you Dan Oscar/Mike: my musings and ramblings on the worlds of data science and visualization, sport, politics and current affairs.  Hope you enjoy!

Dan

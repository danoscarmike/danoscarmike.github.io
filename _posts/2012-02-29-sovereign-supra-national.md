Foreword
*This was a draft post only.  I never published it.  Indeed, I never finished it.  In light of my post last week on identity and nationalism I thought I would share the shard.  From my sarcastic tone I think it's fair to say that I recognized that despite the trends of communication adn globalization and despite my attraction to supra-nationality for the individual I recognized that nationalism was alive and well.
Dan O'Meara 7/20/2016*

I had gotten myself to thinking that the world was flat, you see, irrevocably interconnected and continuously communicating.  Information was flowing freely between open minds, the liberal progressive types out there - everywhere.  Where exactly didn't really matter.
This of course meant that those pesky geographic land borders, frontiers, had finally lost any major significance and stood essentially, only as historic reference of what once was and as a meaningless doff to those few nationalistic types that never left home.

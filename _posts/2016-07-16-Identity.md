In a way it's laughable; but it's true.  When I moved to California I struggled with my identity.  People would ask "Where are you from?".  I wouldn't know how to answer them and I would stutter out an explanation of my dual citizenship, my origin in Ireland and my subsequent adopted home in Australia.  What should have been a simple answer to a simple question turned into a prolonged (and embarrassing) moment of self reflection.

I'm a white guy; born, raised and educated in Ireland.  My parents are Irish.  My grandparents were Irish.  My wife is Irish.  But having lived in Australia for nine years and being a citizen of two countries, was I no longer, simply, Irish?  Had I lost my *Irish-ness*?  The basis of national identity, identifying myself based on my nation was now a flawed construct - it didn't work for me.  

And why do we cling to it, *need* it and *kill* for it?  My conclusion is that it is culture - and therein lies the rub.  Because why would or should culture respect boundaries or borders?
